Here you can find info on how to route your Bokeh HydroDashboard via Application Request Rerouting (ARR) in a Windows IIS web server. Installation Install the URL Rewrite package from the downloads section on the IIS website or Microsoft Web Platform Installer. Install the ARR (application request routing) 3.0 module from the downloads section on the IIS website or Microsoft Web Platform Installer. Note (!) web-socket routing is only possible from ARR 3.0. Configuration of IIS From the left pane, double-click on the main tree node with your server name on it, and from the modules, double-click on Application Request Routing Cache . In the right pane, choose Enable proxy , and set HTTP version to Pass through : In the left pane, right-click on the website you created and select Explore . Windows explorer will open in inetpub\\your_website . Open, or create a new web.config file at this location, so inetpub\\your_website\\web.config : You can copy-paste this section: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <configuration> <system.webServer> <rewrite> <rules> <rule name=\"Bokeh proxy\" enabled=\"true\" stopProcessing=\"true\"> <match url=\"(.*)\" /> <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"http://127.0.0.1:5003/{R:1}\" /> </rule> </rules> </rewrite> </system.webServer> </configuration> Allow web-socket routing After restarting your IIS the backend-app should be re-routed to the root-adress of your website. If your app runs with content you're done. If not, you will only see an empty html page without content. In this case you have to enable the WebSocket Protocol in the Add Roles and Features Wizard of your server: Host for production (NGiNX load balancer) Bokeh HydroDashboards are scalable. Here we show how we can distribute Bokeh HydroDashboards over multiple proesses using a NGiNX load balancer. With a similar setup you can distribute Bokeh HydroDashboards over (even more) multiple backend servers. For more info go to: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html Installation Download the stable version of nginx for windows, unzip it and put this in a chosen folder. Configuration of the load balancer The folder conf contains the configuration file: nginx.conf. We need to change this file to enable load balancing. The example below shows the required configuration if we want to distribute the bokeh app traffic over 4 local hosts (5004,5005,5006 and 5007) via the least connection method. The server is listening on port 5003. events {} http { upstream bokeh { least_conn; server 127.0.0.1:5004; # Bokeh Server 0 server 127.0.0.1:5005; # Bokeh Server 1 server 127.0.0.1:5006; # Bokeh Server 2 server 127.0.0.1:5007; # Bokeh Server 3 } server{ listen: 5003; location / { proxy_pass http://bokeh; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\"; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port; proxy_buffering off; } } } Start Bokeh HydroDashboards Your nginx configuration is now ready.
